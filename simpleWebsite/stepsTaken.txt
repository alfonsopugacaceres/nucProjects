This mini project was started to host a simple website and make it available to the worldwide web

Start of Project
-Obtained NUC mini pc to host small websever. I included two separate drives, one for the Ubuntu Server Operating 
	System and the other drive containing my developmet Ubuntu environment.
-I created a barebones implementation of a website I want to host. Since the barebones website is done, now I must 
	create a webserver to host the website.
